The last months I got a lot of mails regarding my plugins (especially for the Tabular LOV). I really appreciate your interest though I have to tell you guys that I give no support for them. Anyways I&#8217;d like to help you but my limited time schedule doesn&#8217;t permit. I created these plugins with the intention to give something back to the community So any requests to ask me to extend the plugins for free are useless, I published them as a result of actual projects and if I think it is necessary for my current work I&#8217;ll go on working on them. This solutions are for developers who are thankful that I speed up their project. I encourage everybody to make changes on the source and if you want I&#8217;ll publish the results here.

Cheers,  
Damien
