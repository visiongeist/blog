[Good news everyone][1]. Today I officially release my touch gestures library [toe.js][2]. It makes use of the jQuery&#8217;s special event API to fire events, so you can easily integrate it in your current jQuery based projects. For more details check out the [Github project][2] or simple download the [latest build][3].

Version 1 supports the following events: tap, doubletap, taphold, swipe (up, down, left, right), transform (transformstart, transformend with rotation and scale)
