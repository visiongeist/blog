The next version of [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) is approaching this summer and with a lot of changes on the UI level. 
 
Join [Gilles](https://twitter.com/gilknob) and me at [Circuit](http://www.citytechinc.com/content/circuit/en/sessions.html#interface) in Chicago to learn more about the new ways how to customize your User Interface in AEM 6. A brief outline what the speak will cover:

1 - Sling Resource Merger

The new resource merger will stop the replication of full JCR trees under apps. With the new resource merger it is possible to overlay certain nodes without replicating all their ancestors. This includes adding, modifying and remove properties of a node or its children.

2 - Build and modify Administration

Build your own admin views or extend from an existing one by making usage of our extensive UX framework build into AEM 6.

3 - Authoring / Page Editing

The new touch enabled page authoring allows a broad range of extension points. From plugging in a new inline editor to a complete new layer for your custom view.
