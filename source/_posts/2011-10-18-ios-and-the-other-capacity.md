Recently I updated my iPhone to iOS5, which was pretty painful because after I successfully loaded the new version on my phone I figured out that something was reducing disk capacity. In iTunes it is marked in the capacity bar as &#8220;Other&#8221;. And this misterious &#8220;Other&#8221; reserved more than a gigabyte and a half on my Phone. Unfortunately I bought a 16GB iPhone so I lost a lot of space and I needed to get rid of it. Anyways I never figured out what this &#8220;Other&#8221; was and I couldn&#8217;t find a good solution for this. After trying to clean with a backup (this son of a b\**** was also in my backups) I had to restore it to factory default and sync everything from my computer again&#8230; Maybe someone is smarter than me and can explain what this &#8220;Other&#8221; was.
