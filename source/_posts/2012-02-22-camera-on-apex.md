A current client needed a possibility to add a camera frame to an APEX application. So I created a plugin for his need.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-144" title="apex_camera" src="http://damien.antipa.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/apex_camera-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" />][1]

It still has some bugs but it is so super easy to configure. You can [try the plugin.][2] I need to fix some bugs and check some license issues but I think I&#8217;ll publish it at the end of the week.
